# Course-Evaluation-System
Students may rate a lecture and professors can see the rating filtered by course and class.

## Project Overview
Professors love hearing feedback from students on how they can improve the lecture and make it more insighting for the students. Often, I had professors that would hand out a paper at the end of every lecture for students to give anonymous feedback about the lecture. This would be very time consuming reading every paper, every lecture and sorting them for the records. This project allows for a professor to login and add courses that they teach and the system will automatically generate a session ID based on the weekly evaluation times and start, end days of the semester. These sessions contain a randomly generated evaluation password for the students which the professor can change at any time. The professor can view reports for each session for all sessions of a course over the semester. The professor can also see a chart for every report. This project allows for a student to login to the courses he's enrolled in, and anonymously leave feedback for professors of the corresponding class and date. 

## Project Goals

* Anonymous course evaluation system for students and professors
* Professor:
  * Can login with his username and password.
  * The system automatically generates evaluation sessions based on the weekly evaluation times and the start and end days of the semester.
  * The auto-generated sessions contain a randomly generated evaluation password for the students.
  * The Professor can change the evaluation password at any time.
  * The system will automatically create or delete evaluation session accordingly. 
  * The professor can also manually add, edit, and delete evaluation sessions and courses.
  * The courses the professor is currently teaching will be visible in the dashboard.
  * A professor can view what students think about a specific lecture over the course of a semester.
  * The professor can access a chart view for an overall summary.
  * Professor will hopefully be able to improve based on the feedback in subsequent lectures.
* Student:
  * Can login with his username and password.
  * The courses the student is currently taking will be visible in the dashboard.
  * A student can anonymously rate and comment a specific lecture.
  * Student will hopefully have a better experience in subsequent lectures.
