# Course-Evaluation-System
A project to allow for students to write feedback about professors and professors can see the feedback that was left for them.

## Project Overview
Professors love hearing feedback from students on how they can improve the lecture and make it more insighting for the students. Often, I had professors that would hand out a paper at the end of every lecture for students to give anonymous feedback about the lecture.
